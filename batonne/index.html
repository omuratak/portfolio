        <section>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Food waste is a major social issue, which causes both (1) economic loss and (2) negative impact on the environment. In Japan, approximately <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">8% of edible food are being disposed</strong> (2016).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>How might we reduce food waste?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>We designed a <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">“food sharing” app</strong> where users can buy “food that is still fresh and edible but needs to be thrown away soon” for cheaper from restaurants and grocery stores.</p>
        </section>
      </article>
      <article class="context">
        <h2 class="work-h2 batonne-green">Context</h2>
        <p>This project was part of a school group project, where we were assigned teams to work on a mobile app of choice, and create a working prototype; we were free to work on any kind of app. </p>
        <p>We worked in a team of 3. As part of the team, I facilitated team discussions/ideations, created wireframes & hi-fi prototypes for some of the features, and conducted user testing.</p>

      <article class="process">
        <h2 class="work-h2 batonne-green">Process</h2>
        <section class="process-desc">
          <div class="funnel-flex">
            <div class="funnel-text">
              <p>Given the assignment, we started off ideating. We gathered issues we wanted to solve, and eventually landed on “food waste”. We hypothesized that <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">“creating a platform where restaurants can share their food cheaply before disposing them to interested users can help reduce food waste”.</strong></p>
              <p>We first did a quick desk research to understand the “food waste” issue better. We found that indeed, food waste is a big issue: 33% of food shipped are being disposed, and out of that, 23% are still edible (= 8% of food shipped are being thrown away even though it is still edible). We became confident that addressing “food lost” can have a large impact on this issue.</p>

            <div class="funnel-img"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-funnel.svg" alt="funnel image"></div>
          </div>
          <p>From there, we followed the human centered design approach, while also keeping in mind the 5 elements of user experience. </p>
          <div class="hcd-process-img"><img src="../images/hcd-process.svg" alt="HCD process image"></div>
        </section>
        <section class="understand-define">
          <h3>1. Understand and Define</h3>
          <p>We first wanted to understand the current experience around eating, in order to highlight their needs that our app can potentially fulfill. We conducted quick user interviews (n = 2) and derived a user persona as well as a user journey. (In hindsight, I think we should have directly tested our concept against these users to see if our hypothesis was on the right track.)</p>
          <div class="intermed-flex">
            <div class="persona intermed"><a href="#modal-persona" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-persona.png" alt="Batonne persona image"></a></div>
            <div class="journey intermed"><a href="#modal-journey" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-journey.png" alt="Batonne journey image"></a></div>
          </div>
          <p>After we clarified the users’ current experience through user modeling,  we derived <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">three key insights</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="list-item">Users in central Tokyo face a lack of options when looking to buy groceries even if they want to cook, and would like to be able to buy groceries from nearby restaurants</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item">Users usually decide whether to cook or not first before proceeding, but actually would like to switch between the two options more flexibly</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item">Eating out / ordering delivery is costly and not financially sustainable, and would like to have cheaper options other than convenience store food</span></li>
          </ol>
          <p>These insights supported our hypothesis, and also informed us of key features that the app should have.<br>We came up with the following features:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="list-item">Look for food (both cooked and raw) through browsing and searching features</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item">Mark and save restaurants through a favorite feature</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item">Purchase food through a payment feature</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item">Go to the restaurant to pick up food through navigation and hand-off features</span></li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="design-evaluate">
          <h3>2. Design and Evaluate</h3>
          <p>Given the features we decided on, we defined the <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">information architecture</strong>. We first created objects, their properties, and actions. After that, we organized the relationships between the objects and their views (collection vs. single).</p>
          <div class="intermed-flex">
            <div class="object intermed"><a href="#modal-object" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-object.svg" alt="Batonne object image"></a></div>
            <div class="object-rel intermed"><a href="#modal-object-rel" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-object-rel.svg" alt="Batonne object relationship image"></a></div>
          </div>
          <p>Based on the information architecture, we put together a <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">wireframe</strong>, and put it through a round of user testing (n = 3) to understand if there were any usability issues. While putting together the wireframe, we also defined the visual system. Putting together the wireframe and visual system, we put together a <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">hi-fi prototype</strong>.</p>
          <div class="intermed-flex">
            <div class="visual-system intermed"><a href="#modal-visual-sys" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-visual-system.png" alt="Batonne visual system image"></a></div>
            <div class="wireframe intermed"><a href="#modal-wireframe" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-wireframe.png" alt="Batonne wireframe image"></a></div>
            <div class="hifi intermed"><a href="#modal-hifi" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-hifi.png" alt="Batonne hi-fi prototype image"></a></div>
          </div>
          <p>We conducted three rounds of <strong class="highlight batonne-green-underline">user testing</strong>, each time assessing and refining the design based on usability issues we found. We faced the most difficulty designing and refining the payment ~ navigation ~ pick-up UI for our edge case: ordering multiple items from different restaurants. </p>
          <p>We first set up the UI so that the user would pay, navigate, and pick up separately for each restaurant. However, we quickly realized that the user would need to go through the payment screen multiple times for each restaurant, which would be quite annoying. </p>
          <div class="cart-v1 intermed"><a href="#modal-cart-v1" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-cart-v1.png" alt="Batonne cart UI version 1 image"></a></div>
          <p>We then refined our payment flow so that the user can pay for all items in their cart at once. In terms of the navigation ~ pick-up flow, we showed the user a list of food items to be picked up, and a multi-destination route that the user can follow to pick up food from restaurants in different locations. However, this actually confused the user, because there was too much information shown in one screen.</p>
          <div class="cart-v2 intermed"><a href="#modal-cart-v2" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-cart-v2.png" alt="Batonne cart UI version 2 image"></a></div>
          <p>Given this, we separated out the list of food items grouped by restaurants and the route to the restaurants to avoid information overload. We made sure to sort the restaurants by distance from current location, so that the users would easily know which restaurant they were supposed to go first. (In hindsight, I think we could have minimized the number of iterations by thinking through the payment ~ navigation ~ pick-up flow more in detail, possibly through a to-be user journey.)</p>
          <div class="cart-v3 intermed"><a href="#modal-cart-v3" rel="modal:open"><img src="../images/batonne/batonne-cart-v3.png" alt="Batonne cart UI version 3 image"></a></div>
        </section>

      <article class="reflection">
        <h2 class="work-h2 batonne-green">Reflection</h2>
        <p>For this to actually work in real life, I believe the key success factor would be the number of restaurants and supermarkets to join the platform. We would definitely need to work closely with restaurants and supermarkets to design a good experience for them.</p>
        <p>From this project, I learned how important putting our design in front of users is. Multiple iterations and testing at different stages of the project helped minimize course corrections and major rework towards the end.</p>
        <p>I also realized the difficulty of empowering users to create social impact without alienating anyone. Through this app, we wanted to help users realize the positive impact they can have on the environment, but we also did not want users to feel bothered by overly aggressive messaging. This time we kept our messaging to a minimum, but I would like to continue exploring the balance. </p>
